# 📚 Library Management System

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a console-based application designed to streamline library operations. It provides a secure and efficient way to manage book inventories, track issued/returned books, and maintain data across sessions.

## 🏢 Internship Project
This project was developed during my internship at Syntacxhub. It demonstrates the practical application of Core Java concepts in building a functional management tool.

## ✨ Key Features
- **🔐 Admin Security:** Mandatory login system to protect library data.
- **📖 Book Management:** Add, remove, and search for books easily.
- **🔄 Issue & Return:** Real-time status tracking (Available/Issued).
- **💾 Data Persistence:** Uses Java File I/O (Serialization) to save data in a `.txt` file so records are never lost.
- **📊 Clean UI:** Formatted table output for better readability in the terminal.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Language:** Java (JDK 8+)
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs), Collections API, File Handling, Exception Handling.
- **Tool:** IntelliJ IDEA

## 📸 How it Works
1. **Login:** Enter the admin password to access the menu.
2. **Manage:** Add new books with unique IDs.
3. **Transaction:** Issue books to students and update their status.
4. **Auto-Save:** Data is automatically saved to `library_data.txt` upon exit.
